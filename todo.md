## 1. Add a Database Layer

You’ll need this for:

- User accounts & auth (to separate data for each person or bot instance)
- Assistant configurations (prompt templates, personality, triggers)
- Chat history & context (long-term memory)
- Event/reminder storage (for scheduling tasks)

Recommended stack:

- PostgreSQL — strong, scalable, relational DB
- Use Prisma ORM (TypeScript-friendly, easy migrations, schema-first dev)
- If you want quick and flexible storage for chat logs, MongoDB or Redis can complement.

## 2. Modular Assistant Architecture

Structure your code so each “assistant” is a separate module or plugin:

- Core service: handles routing, user/session management, message handling
- Assistant modules:

  - Trader Summarizer
  - Reminder Scheduler
  - News/Market Watcher
  - Quick Actions (email, Slack, Telegram commands)

- Each module defines:

  - Triggers (new message, scheduled time, keyword detection, etc.)
  - Action (summarize, send alert, create task)
  - Prompt template for AI

---

## 3. Event & Message Listening

For your trader example:

- Integrate with APIs/webhooks from:

  - Telegram Bot API
  - Discord Bot API
  - Email (IMAP listener or Gmail API)

- Build a listener service that:

  - Receives raw messages
  - Feeds to AI for summarization
  - Returns proposed reply buttons or text
  - Logs in DB

---

## 4. Scheduling & Reminders

For reminders:

- Use BullMQ (Redis-backed job queue) or Agenda for cron-like scheduling
- Store reminders in DB with:

  - Date/time
  - Recurrence rules
  - Assigned assistant
  - Delivery channel

- When due → send via the right integration (Telegram, email, app notification)

---

## 5. Persistent Memory & Context

- Store conversation summaries instead of raw chat logs to reduce token usage
- Implement vector search (e.g., using Pinecone, Weaviate, or Postgres pgvector) for semantic recall
- Allow assistants to pull from past context automatically

---

## 6. Multi-Platform Deployment

- Telegram Bot: each assistant can be a separate bot or command
- Discord Bot: channels for each assistant
- Web App: same chat frontend, but selectable assistants in a sidebar
- Email Gateway: for “offline” assistant interaction

---

## 7. Business Considerations

To make it a SaaS platform:

- Add subscription tiers (free limited usage, paid higher limits + custom assistants)
- Usage tracking per user (stored in DB)
- Stripe for payments
- Admin dashboard to manage assistants, users, logs

### Example Flow for “Trader Summarizer”

1. Telegram webhook → listener service
2. Message detected → stored in DB
3. Summarization prompt to OpenAI → result saved
4. Push notification to trader with:

   - Summary
   - Suggested quick replies (buttons)

5. Trader clicks → sends message via bot
